          <h3>A message from the owner</h3>
        <p class="open">
            I consider myself a second generation "dirt digger" or in other words, it's not only in my blood but I've grown up learning how to use equipment for earth work and love doing it.  My goal is to run this business in a way that people just won't consider going anywhere else for their excavation needs and to provide an almost "family-like" environment for our staff so that our work can continue to be more than just a job.
            <br>

        <h3>Dirt Digging with Professionalism & Innovation</h3>
        <p class="open">

            From the start I decided if I'm going to do this I'm going to do it right.  We do not run this business in a "pickup contractor" manner.  Our office manager sees to it that every job is tracked thoroughly and we are always upfront with clients to ensure that there are no surprises in the end.  We have our own hammers to dig through rock with a simple switch of an attachment.  We have our own survey equipment that we use in conjunction with project surveyors to check the points of any foundation or site to ensure no under-digging or over-digging--which saves time and money and produces a better finished product.  Beginning in 2009 we are using the latest excavation bidding software, Paydirt by Trimble, to make our bids highly accurate. This software allows us to calculate yardage and quantities by creating a 3-D model of your site and overlaying the proposed topo over the existing.  It is very amazing and informative to see your job as a 3-D model. It accurately quantifies all cuts, fills, import/export, and any sub-layers such as driveway gravel/ concrete or patios right down to the cubic inch! I've always said that "you're only as good as your subcontractors."  So we have made it our goal to make our clients look as good as  possible in regards to our field of work and all those who we work with on the job.  We have ongoing relationships with the local inspectors and other subcontractors and have worked with and been recommended by many of them.  We are the first sub-trade to begin a project and it is our goal to be helpful and work well with others to keep the job moving along smoothly.

        </p>
        <h3>Not too big . . . not too small</h3>
        <p class="open">
            Our staff includes anywhere from 8 to 12 people depending on the season and we operate 9 machines and 3 dump trucks. We try to let the machines do most of the work to keep laborer and management costs down. In all industries there are always a handful of businesses that just seem to do it better than the rest by keeping things simple and maintaining low overhead with minimal spending while still offering the same services as their competition. It makes sense and we have naturally taken this approach.  We don't have an expensive shop that adds more travel time and other unnecessary costs to our overhead.  Laborers come on the job only if absolutely needed.  If an operator needs to jump out of a machine to dig something by hand, this is much more efficient than having a laborer stand around waiting for those moments of actual work.  Of course on larger jobs, laborers are easier to keep busy.  Each member of our staff is fully responsible for his own job and with that added responsibility comes their freedom to run the job the way they like, as long as it's done right, efficiently, and on time.  Over the years this has produced our staff to be the very best employees who I consider to be "super-producers" and they work as if they are entrepreneurs working for their own cause. If everyone does well as a whole we are all treated well so each employee is looking out for the bottom interest which in turn makes your job go smoothly the first time.
